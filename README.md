 ## i am not responsible for your actions! IN EVERY WAY ##
Your warranty is void. Or valid, probably?
I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, etc
YOU are choosing to make these modificiations, and if
you point your finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you or something.
Goodluck on testing.

Requirements:
Nethunter app
Nethunter Terminal
Nethunter KeX Client
Atleast 8gb free space to ensure System stability
Root Access

###      How to install     ###
First:
You need to have installed nethunter rom, or any rom actually as long as you have the following installed

I will soon make a ROM with nethunter features out of the box

Second:
Install Magisk(Anything above magisk v20 is enough)

Third:
Download chroot from this repository
Put the downloaded chroot into your phone's internal storage
you can rename it to kalifs-arm64-full.tar.xz

Fourth:
Enter the nethunter app
In the nethunter app select Kali Chroot Manager,
click install, type the location of the chroot you downloaded (kali-arm64-full.tar.xz)


Latest Changelog:

Update V3
New Update is a little late but that wait is over!
New update features old kali repo combined with kali.download as mirror,
Packages like mitmf and bdfactory are installed using the old.kali.org repo and thus removed from the project files
You can still use /etc, /opt and /usr directory of the project to add your code to the chroot
New github packages include:
