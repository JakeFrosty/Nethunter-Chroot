 ## i am not responsible for your actions! IN EVERY WAY ##
Your warranty is void. Or valid, probably?
I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, etc
YOU are choosing to make these modificiations, and if
you point your finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you or something.
Goodluck on testing.
